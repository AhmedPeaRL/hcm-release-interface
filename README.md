This repository is not a project.

It does not announce.
It does not ask.
It does not invite.

It exists as a surface.

A place where a release may land
without becoming a request,
without turning into a signal,
without asking for continuation.

Nothing starts here.
Nothing is promised.
Nothing is completed.

If something arrived,
it arrived already complete.
If nothing arrives,
this surface remains intact.

Presence is sufficient.
